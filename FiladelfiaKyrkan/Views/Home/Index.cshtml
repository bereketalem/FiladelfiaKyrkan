        <h2>The Scriptures Inspired</h2>
        <p>
            We believe that all Scripture, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man,
            the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct (2 Timothy 3:15-17;1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).

        <h2>The Godhead</h2>
        <p>We believe in one God, the living and true God, existing eternally in three Persons - the Father, the Son,
            and the Holy Spirit - each having precisely the same nature, attributes, 
            and perfections (Matthew 28:18-19; Mark 12:29; John 1:14; Acts 5:3-4; II Corinthians 13:14; Hebrews 1:1-3;Revelation 1:4-6).ts.</p>

        <h2> God the Father</h2>
        <p>We believe that God the Father, unlimited in holiness, power and majesty, especially showed His exceedingly great love in giving His only beloved Son to redeem man from sin for eternal fellowship with Him. 
            This act of grace was carried out according to His eternal, sovereign plan. 
            The nature of the Father is completely and perfectly revealed in the Son (Genesis 3:15; Isaiah 53:1-10; John 3:16;14:6-9; Romans 16:20; Colossians 1:15, 18-20)..</p>
